            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>
                You have a lot of students in your classes. How often would you say a student needed their sewing machine serviced?  <br>

                My mother, Cheryl, has been sewing for the past 20 years and always hated when she needed to get her machine serviced because her machine would not work for some obscure reason or it was just time to do so. She would have to pay $80+ dollars to get it fixed. I bet you and your students have felt the way she did. About 4 years ago my mother took classes to learn to fix all kinds of sewing machines. Since then, she has been fixing machines for countless people with different types of machines. From businesses with industrial machines, to stay at home mothers who love to make dresses for their daughters.  <br>

                Cheryl would love to work with you for your students, so they have a place to take their machines when it is time for their machines to be serviced. She is free any day after school hours and weekends, and will do any services for students and teachers for $45, that’s almost half the price! She is skilled, reliable and affordable. What do you say?

            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Our purpose is to help all creative minds be able to make their creations come to life. Any designer, tailor, or seamstress uses a sewing machine to create the most amazing outfits. On occasion, sewing machines need a little up keep. They either break, need a new part, or a customary clean out from all the left-over material. Our job is to make sure that you get your machine back better than how you brought it in. With all the service we do, we are proud to say that we give the best customer service. We always leave our customers with smiling faces and a machine to make their wildest creations. 
            </p>

            <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
            <p>
                We are here to help all people who want to create masterpieces with a needle and thread. We love to serve people from college students starting their careers, to mothers who want to create clothing for their children, to youth who have just began their journey in the art of sewing. No matter what time of life or how much experience you have, every sewing machine will have to be serviced. We offer quick and reliable sewing machine fixes and checks. Our prices are low-cost compared to the major businesses who are usually a bit more pricey. To set up an appointment go to our website: <br> (www.Peachesandseams.com) or call at 555-555-5555.

            <h2>Misson Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Peaches and Seams brings understanding and trust to anyone who sews by making sure their sewing machines work to the best of their ability. Many people who own sewing machines rarely bring their machines in to be serviced, which can take its toll on the machine causing it to break down more frequently. Our purpose is to help those whose machines need a little TLC every now and again to get the best service. Anyone with a sewing machine and lives in the Phoenix Valley area is fit for our business! We offer the option to pick up at our location or have your machine brought back to you. We pride ourselves on giving the best service and care to the machines that get brought to our hands. We will get you back to sewing like the wind in no time!
